<p><b>TODO:</b><br/>
- writing and reading, speaking and listening with AI and Google Assistant<br/>
- reverse dictionary with AI and several dictionaries with defining vocabulary<br/>
- better defining dictionary and example sentences (english wiktionary / voa instead of oxford)<br/>
- highlighting with color as a mnemonic device (not in the order of reading but same frequent words, letters or phonemes all over the text)<br/>
- input formant patterns from keyboard like chords<br/>
- optimize to search and load faster with indexes for words based on consonants and vowels (release node.js scripts)<br/>
- add sound for diphtongs, British pronounciation (use a dictionary from the defining) and IPA transcription<br/>
- highlight short and long vowels (in British version)<br/>
- definitions in several languages (Google provides some but not all)<br/>
- underline only pronounced vowels<br/>
- calligraphy (touch sensitivity)<br/>
- app for android (also with ordinary keyboard sorted by sound)<br/>
- general Storygrid / BS structure (json)<br/>
- algorithmic filter for explicit / overused / repetitive words and synonyms suggestion<br/>
- more languages (Hebrew, _)
