<p><b>TODO:</b><br/>
- upgrade to general language learning app to complete the randomly missing words and phrases in word definitions for grammar and common vocabulary (look up by word or several (in specific order or not), sentence construction by Google Cloud NL parser and Google Books Ngrams with several queries or DictionaryAPI examples / phrasebook)<br/>
- is highlighting letters or phonemes with color a mnemonic device ?<br/>
- input formant patterns from keyboard like chords<br/>
- optimize to search and load faster with indexes for words based on consonants and vowels (release node.js scripts)<br/>
- add sound for diphtongs, British pronounciation (use a dictionary from the defining) and IPA transcription<br/>
- highlight short and long vowels (in British version)<br/>
- underline only pronounced vowels<br/>
- calligraphy (touch sensitivity)<br/>
- app for android (also with ordinary keyboard sorted by sound)<br/>
- general Storygrid / BS structure (json)<br/>
